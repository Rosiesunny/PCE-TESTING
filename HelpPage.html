            <body> PCE Not-Cataloguer stands for <b>Pixel Cat's End - Not Cataloguer</b> <br>
                <b>Pixel Cat's End</b> is a pet site featuring little not-cats, and can be found <a href = "https://www.pixelcatsend.com/home">here</a><br>
                The <b>Not-Cataloguer</b> is a utility program designed to make info recording easier by allowing users to copy cat pages, and automatically grab data from the copied text for future sorting. There are lots of goals for this program eventually, but for now, what you see is what there is. You can follow development on Discord most actively, or the forum thread for this utlity on PCE's forums on a more occasional basis. We're looking for help in beta testers and would love to find someone who enjoys doing html/css styling.

                The forum thread for it is <a href = "https://www.pixelcatsend.com/forum&topic=7879&page=1#op"> here</a> <br>
